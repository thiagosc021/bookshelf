- The initial screen shows a list of books. Each row shows the book title and the authorâ€™s name.
- Tapping on a row will take you to the books detail page.
- The detail view should present the books details including: title, author, cover, release year, and description.
- The detail view should include a back button that, when pressed, takes you back to the initial screen.
